A simple, complete, and standalone service mesh.

osm-edge runs on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). The osm-edge control plane implements [Pipy Repo](https://flomesh.io/pipy/docs/en/operating/repo/0-intro) and is configured with [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/) APIs. osm-edge injects a [Pipy](https://flomesh.io/pipy) proxy as a sidecar container next to each instance of an application.

* Read an [overview of osm-edge](/docs/overview/about/) and more about [the design of its components](/docs/overview/osm_components/).
