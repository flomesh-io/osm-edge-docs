A simple, complete, and standalone service mesh.

osm-edge runs on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). The osm-edge control plane implements [Pipy Repo](https://flomesh.io/docs/en/operating/repo/0-intro) and is configured with [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/) APIs. osm-edge injects a Pipy proxy as a sidecar container next to each instance of an application.

To learn more about osm-edge:
* Go through all the [getting started articles](docs/getting_started/) to install osm-edge and run a sample application.
* Read an [overview of osm-edge](docs/overview/about/) and more about [the design of its components](docs/overview/osm_components/).
* Run additional example scenarios from the [Demos](docs/demos/) section.
